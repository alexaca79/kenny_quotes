"&gt;&gt;&gt; People are never in perfect condition for a relationship. People are always bringing in old baggage and past experiences that are painful, that are part of the beauty and truth of their nature. With all of that, relationships can be even deeper and more meaningful."
"&gt;&gt;&gt;Readiness can be about priorities, or about giving yourself time to heal after a loss. Readiness can be preparation, packing a backpack full of communication skills and an open heart, on the chance that you’ll need them on your journey. But readiness might also be a sort of magical thinking—Once I’ve gathered all the ingredients, then the spell will be complete, and a relationship will appear.

“A lot of people feel like, If I do X, Y, or Z, then this will happen,” Luo says. “But life rarely ever works that way, except for taxes and death.”"
"&gt;&gt;&gt;Readiness, then, is not a result of achieving certain life milestones, or perfect mental health. And checking off items on a checklist doesn’t guarantee a relationship when the checklist is complete. It’s impossible to be ready for a relationship. But feeling ready—making that mysterious mental leap—matters."
"&gt;&gt;&gt;There’s no doubt that these sorts of skills are helpful in relationships, but Schwartz Gottman isn’t convinced they should be prerequisites, qualities people need to bring to relationships, rather than developing within a relationship. After all, it’s only through practice that people will get better at communicating, for example. If we all waited until we were perfectly well adjusted before entering a relationship, the human race would die out."

"also, client has a VP who believes it's more flexible to go custom development than SaaS for grants management system.

rationale is that with a custom dev you can just pay the developers to make any changes you want when you want it as long as you are working with a strong and responsive vendor.

my draft response so far...
- would need at least 3 FTE (QA, Dev, BA/dev), so that's at least $200,000 a year compared to $80,000 annual license
- with a small staff, skillsets would be broad and general
- it's really hard to build something from scratch that would meet your expectations of a finished, bug-free product comparable to SAP or Salesforce
- you don't have software development management experience, you're a grants officer (glorified giant cheque writer)"
